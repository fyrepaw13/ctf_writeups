## No-name minor

The challenge provides us with a binary that presents a menu that allows the user to borrow a loan, repay the loan, mining for money, buy a name and change name. The goal is to get a name. But 

- To buy a name, you need to have money.
- To have money you cannot simply mine, cause it will take a lot of time.
- So you need to loan and then repay them.
